                              Electric Discharge Machining(EDM) is a well-established non-traditional machining process suitable for the manufacturing of engineering components that are very much difficult-to-machine by other conventional machining processes and geometrically complex features. <br>
                             The working principle of EDM machine is "Melting and Vaporization". </p>

                            <blockquote><i><p>2.1 EDM machine </p></i></blockquote>
                            <p>The main characteristics of EDM machine is as follows:
                              <ul>
                                <li>

                                </ii>
                              </ul>
                            </p>
                            <h3>Categories of EDM machine</h3>
                            <p>As per the applications of EDM, it is classified into five ways. They are explained below.</p>
                            <p><b>1. Die Sinking EDM</p></b>
                            <p>This is a conventional EDM process where the workpiece and electrode are immersed in a dielctric medium. The dielctric medium acts as a light lubricating agent and acts as a insulator that helps to control the arc discharge.  A servo mechanism is used to maintain the distance between workpiece and electrode. In this EDM, soft metallic electrodes can be used to cut hard metals like carbides, stainless steels, titanium alloys etc.</p>
                            <p><b>2. Electric Discharge Milling</b></p>
                            <p>This process is nothing but the development of CNC countering EDM. Similar to the CNC milling cutter, a rotating cylindrical electrode is used to remove material in a pre-programmed way. The control system is used to decide the feed rate of the electrode and to know the explosion status between the cathode and the anode.</p>
                            <p><b>3. Electric Discharge Grinding</b></p>
                            <p>The technique used in the electric discharge grinding is similar to EDM machine. Here revoloving wheel is the electrode which is electrically conductive material. Here grinding wheel acts as cathode and workpiece as anode. Rotating motion of wheel controls the inter electrode gap which eliminate the flushing gap with dielectric. The material removal mechanism is same as conventional EDM machine. Electric discharge grinding is economical compared to the conventional diamond grinding</p>
                            <p><b>4. Wire-cut EDM</b></p>
                            <p>The wire EDM is used to produce very complex shapes with the very thin wire. Any hard material can be easily machined irespective of their thickness. The diameter of 2μm to 3μm wire is used as electrode. The mechanism is same as EDM machine but handling wire feeding mechanism is too dificult. The debries are washed out by using flushing. The dies and punches above 300mm thickness are difficult to manufacture and

                                <h3>Process Variables</h3>
                                <p>EDM process depend upon some input parameters which influnce the machining rate. The parametrs are described below:</p>
                                <u1>
                                  <li>Discharge Current or Peak Current:</li>
                                <p>The maximum amount of current available for each pulse. It starts at zero and rises until it reaches a peak value which is called discharge current.</p>
                                  <li>Discharge Voltage:</li>
                                <p>When the current flows through the plasma channel, the open circuit Voltage goes down and the electrode gap comes to steady stay position. It is the most important factor which controlls the spark energy.</p>
                                  <li>Pulse-on Time:</li>
                                <p>The ionization and sparking time is known as pulse on time or pulse duration.It is measured in tems of microseconds(μs). The amount of energy applied at this time is directly poropational to the material removal rate(MRR). Due to this, high material removal rate and good surface roghness is obained even at high spark energy.</p>
                                  <li>Pulse-off Time:</li>
                                <p>The duration of time between two consecutive pulse duration is called pulse off time or pulse interval. It is calculated when supply voltage is off. In this time period, deionized dielectric regains its strength for next cycle. In the mean time, the molten metal can get solidified and debris will be washed out from the machining zone through flushing.</p>
                                <li>Duty Cycle:</li>
                                <p>Duty cycle is the percentage of pulse on time with relative to the total cycle time. Generally higher duty cycle means high cutting efficiency.</p>
                                <p>Duty cycle (%) =(Pulse-on time/Total cycle time)X100</p>
                                <p>Total cycle time (μs) = Pulse-on time + Pulse-off time</p>
