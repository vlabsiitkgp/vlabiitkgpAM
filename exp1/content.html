                             <p> In the Mechanical Engineering field, Lathe machine plays an important role in removing unwanted material. Here i am going to discuss the lathe machine in detail. </p>
                            <u1>
                              <li> Lathe is called as the father of machine tool. Lathe machine is one of the most important machine tools which is used in metalworking industries. </li>
                              <li> It was invented by David Wilkinson in 18th centuary.</li>
                              <li> The main function of a Lathe machine is to remove metal from work piece to give required size and shape.</li>
                              <li> It operates on the principle of a rotating work piece and a fixed cutting tool.
                              </li>
                              <li> Lathe machine is also known as "Center lathe" because workpiece or job is held in between two centers. </li>
                            </u1>

                                <blockquote><i><p> Fig 1.1 Pictorial View of Lathe Machine</p></i></blockquote>
                              </center>
                            <p style="font-size:17px;"><b> Function of Lathe Machine: </b></p>
                            <u1>
                              <li>A lathe machine is the one of the most versatile machine tools in the present industry.</li>
                              <li>  The main function of a Lathe is to remove excess material from rotating workpiece in the form of chips using a stationary cutting tool. </li>
                              <li>More than 25 operations can be carried out by lathe machine according to their application but lathe is primarily used for turning operation.</li>
                              <li>Lathe machine is operated by multi speed geared electric drives.</li>
                              <li>In a Lathe machine, work piece is held in a chuck and tool is moved at an angle 90 degree to the axis. </li>
                            </u1>

                          <p> In lathe machine every individual part performs an important task, some main parts of Lathe are described below: (For reference go to Fig 1.1) </p>
                          <ol>

                          <li> <b>Head stock:</b> Head stock is the important part of lathe machine. It supports the main spindle in the bearings and aligns it properly. It also
                            houses necessary transmission mechanism for different speeds. It consists of main spindle, a chuck fitted at spindle nose, back gear drive and all gear drive.</li>
                          <li> <b>Bed:</b> The bed is the base and backbone of a lathe where the headstock and the tailstock are located at either end of the bed. Carriage rests over the bed  and slides over it. The bed is usually made of well-normalized or aged gray or nodular cast iron and provides a heavy, rigid frame on which all the other basic components are mounted. It is manufactured by casting process. It has high wear resistance and compressive strength.</li>
                          <li> <b>Main spindle:</b> It is a hollow cylindrical shaft and long slender jobs can pass through it. It is used for holding the collet where spindle rotates on two large bearings housed on the head stock casting. </li>
                          <li> <b>Tail Stock:</b> Tail stock is located on the right of the bed and opposite to the head stock. tail stock body is bored and housed to the tail stock spindle. This spindle can move front and back inside the hole. Tail stock has a tapered hole to receive dead center of tools like drill bit. Body of tail stock is made up of cast iron.</li>
                          <li> <b>Lead Screw:</b> Lead screw is used to transmit power to carriage through gear and clutch arrangement in the carriage apron.</li>
                          <li> <b>Feed Mechanism:</b> It is used for changing the speed of Lead screw during cutting. There are several feed mechanisms for the movement of carriage and cross sliders. Some of the important mechanisms are explained below. </li>
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li> Belt feed Mechanism: First lathe machine is developed by using this mechanism. In this mechanism, a cone stepped pulley is used for transmitting different speeds. Speed rate can be changed by using a lever which slides over belt, then belt slides over one pulley to another. This mechanismis is easy to construct, ease maintainance and low cost to built. The main disadvantage of this mechanism is belt slipping while changinig sppeds.</li>
                                    <li> Gear Feed Mechanism: In this mechanism power is transmitted from spindle to feed lead screw by using power gear train. Where gear 1 sits back side of the spindle and remaining gears are arranged in tumbler bracket as shown in figure... This bracket is pivoted about the axis of stud gear and a lever is used to operated the bracket. </li>
                                </ol>

                          <li> <b>Carriage:</b> A carriage is one of the most important component in lathe machine. it locates on lathe bed guide ways inbetween head stock and tail stock. Carriage slides over bed and can move towards and away the head stock. It consists of several small and important parts which supports, moves and controls the cutting tool. Some important parts of carriage are discussed below.</li>

                                  <li>  Saddle: A saddle is a H shaped casted component which acts as bridge to connects pair of bed guide ways. Saddle can slide along the bed inbetween head and tail stock. </li>
                                  <li>  Apron: Apron consists of all control keys. It is the front part of the carriage is called as apron. Automatic feed and threading control keys are also located on apron. </li>
                                  <li>  Tool Post: It is used to hold tools rigidly while machining. Tools are selected according to the type of operation  and mounted accordingly on the tool post. Tool post position can be adjusted conviniently. There are diffrent types of tool post such as single way tool post, four way tool post and quick change tool post.</li>

                            <p> The lathe machine is used to remove excess or unwanted material from workpiece in the form of chips. A tool is used to remove material from workpiece at required depth of cut. Depending on the tool movement and tool angle, surface is formed. </p>

                              <p><b>Cutting Speed:</b></p>
                              <p>The speed at which the metal is removed by the tool from the workpiece is termed as cutting speed. Cutting speed is expresses in meters per minute.</p>
                              <p>Cuttting Speed = ΠDN/1000 m/min </p>
                              <p> Where, </p>
                              <p>D = Diameter of the workpiece</p>
                              <p>N = R.P.M of the Spindle or Spindle speed</p>
                              <p><b>Feed:</b></p>
                              <p>In lathe, feed of the tool is the distance the tool advances for each revolution of workpiece. It is expresses in terms of millimeters per revolution(mm/rev).</p>
                              <p><b>Depth of cut:</b></p>
                              <p>It is defined as the perpendicular distance from the machine surface to the uncut surface of the workpiece. Depth of cut is inversely proportional to cutting speed. </p>
                              <p>Depth of cut = (d1-d2)/2 </p>
                              <p>Where,</p>
                              <p>d1 = Diameter of the surface before machining</p>
                              <p>d2 = Diameter of the surface after machining</p>
                              <p> Generally, ratio of the depth of cut to feed varies to 10:1.</p>
                              <p><b>Machining Time:</b></p>
                              <p>It is used to calculate time taken to complete a particular operation. Machining time can be calculated by using spindle speed and feed rate. Measured in terms of minutes.</p>
                              <p>Machining time = L/(f*N) </p>
