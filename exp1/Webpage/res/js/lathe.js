It works by spinning around a piece of metal and cutting away material from it.<br>For example, a lathe was used to make several of the parts of this model sterling engine, such as this part called a flywheel, this part called an axel, and this part called a bushing.<br>Click on Next button to go to the next instructions page.",

        "text":"Here we are turning on the spindle and cutting a little bit of the material off of the part.  We are using that to set to z coordinate system, which describes to the lathe how it moves left to right.  Then we also need to do the same for the radial direction, which is x.  We need to cut a little bit of the material off of the outside, measure it, and then tell the machine that it is at that position.<br>Here, we are using something called a GoTo function, which allows you to make the cutting tool move to a certain palce, which allows us to cut really precise dimensions.  In this case, we are cutting some material away from it until it is at just the perfect size.<br>Next step, we are going to drill a hole in it.  The first step involves center drilling.  The tool that we are about to drill into it is called the center drill.  It will make a small hole that will guide a regular drillbit right through the center.  Once that's done, we can use a process called reaming to make the hole have a really precise size.<br>Next step is going to be to cut off the piece that we want from the rest of the material stock.  This tool is called the cutoff tool.  We need to do a little bit of math to figure out how far left we want to place the cutoff tool.  Then we can use the GoTo function to put it in exaclty the right place.<br>From there, we can put some coolant on it.  That keeps everything from getting too hot.  From there, we can move the cutoff tool into the part, which cuts it off from the rest of the material stock.  Then, we need to find the part, which has fallen into the bottom of the lathe."

If your component is cylindrically symmetric, a lathe is probably the machine that you will use to manufacture it.<br>The safety rules for the rest of the shop apply to the lathes as well.<br>1. Always wear safety glasses and a hat when operating any machinery in the shop.<br>2. However there are a few additional precautions that need to be taken when operating a lathe. First, make sure there are no loose items on your body that can get caught in the machine this includes items like watches bracelets necklaces and especially hair<br>3. The lathe will be spinning very fast during manufacturing and there are several protrusions on the lathe which can catch on hair and clothing. Never reach or lean into the work area when the machine is running.<br>4. In addition loading and unloading parts in the Chuck requires using a small square wrench to tighten the jaws. Never under any circumstances leave this wrench in the Chuck, not even for a moment. If the lane has accidentally started while the wrench is in the Chuck, the wrench will be flung out of the machine and could cause serious injury.<br>These are just some of the main safety concerns with the lathe there are others. Before using the lathe on your own, you will need to be trained by one of the shop staff."

        "text":"The previous section demonstrated a few conservative cuts using a depth of cut of 0.03 inches. If you need to remove a lot of material, it can go faster if you use a more aggressive depth of cut, like 0.1 inches. Let's take a look at a depth of cut of 0.1 inches to see what it looks like.<br>It seemed to work fine without any problems. However, keep in mind that if you use a depth of cut that is too deep, there is a risk of breaking the cutting tool. For this reason, the largest depth of cut that you should ever use is 0.1 inches of diameter at once.",
        "todo":"<hr><strong>Your turn. On the simulation to the right (follow each instruction in order, as written to proceed):</strong><br>Cut out the following shape:<br><img src='res/imgs/goto_shape.png' width=100%>1. Set a GoTo position of x = 1.18 in. and z = -0.6 in (select GoTo, press the x button, then enter 1.18, then abs set. Next follow the same steps, but this time for z). The cutting tool will not be able to move further than these coordinates.<br>2. Do NOT exit the GoTo function interface or the desired GoTo position will no longer be held and you will have to rest.<br>3. As shown in the video, progressively cut out the material up to this position by moving the cutting tool. The lathe must be turned on before cutting, which can be done by pressing the FWD button.<br>4. You will now be able to make a depth of cut of 3. Notice how much faster you are able to cut out the material with an aggressive cut.  Note that too aggressive of a depth of cut can potentially damage the material.<br>5. Turn the spindle off.<br>6. Exit GoTo mode by selecting Return under the control screen.<br>7. Press submit (you will only be able to proceed once the proper shape has been cut out).",
